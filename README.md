Our Core Values
==========================




We are primarily driven by meeting clients goals and objectives.

We release early and often. We fail regularly. This is OK.

We automate all the things.

We favour simple solutions.

We value our automated test suites, but we still manual test.

We succeed and fail together.

We aim to build working wireframe prototypes as early as possible - sometimes even before the client sees the initial designs.
